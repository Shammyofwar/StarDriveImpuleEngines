# StarDriveImpuleEngines

StarDrive  Impulse Engine is the anti-gravity Impulse engine  based on TrekDrive by TheShadow1138, with a few changes, and some additional functionality planned. It can go forward, and reverse, has thrust vectoring, and has a autoland feature. This plug-in was built exclusively for our mod Scifi Shipyards Redux and we have no plans at this time to release it as a stand-alone mod.
